When screening and picking stocks for investment, it's crucial to apply a set of filters to identify fundamentally strong companies at reasonable valuations. Below are key metrics categorized into constraints, foundation filters, valuation filters, and other filters to consider.

## Constraints
These are basic thresholds to ensure the company is stable and of sufficient size:
- **Debt to Equity Ratio < 0.5**: High debt can burden small companies during economic downturns due to interest costs.
- **Market Cap > 3000 Cr**: Focus on mid-to-large cap companies for better liquidity and stability.
- **Market Cap < 20000 Cr**: Avoid very large cap companies that may be less dynamic.

## Foundation Filters
These assess the company's growth and profitability fundamentals:
- **Profit Growth 3Yr > 15%**: Ensures consistent profit expansion over the past three years.
- **Sales Growth 3Yr > 10%**: Indicates revenue growth momentum.
- **EPS Growth 3Yr > 0.5 * Price Growth 3Yr**: Earnings per share growth should keep pace with stock price appreciation.
- **Return on Equity (ROE) > 15%**: Measures how efficiently the company generates profits from shareholders' equity.
- **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) > 20%**: Evaluates profitability relative to total capital employed.
- **FIIDII < 20%**: Foreign Institutional Investor and Domestic Institutional Investor holdings should not be excessively high to avoid volatility.

## Valuation Filters
These ensure the stock is not overpriced:
- **PEG < 2**: Price to Earnings Growth ratio should be reasonable, indicating fair valuation relative to growth.
- **PE < 1.5 * Industry Median PE**: Price to Earnings ratio should not exceed 1.5 times the industry average.
- **PE < 0.5 * Median PE 3Yr**: Current PE should be less than half of the median PE over the past three years.

## Other Filters
Additional checks for financial health and operational quality:
- **Positive Operating Cash Flow**: Ensures the company generates cash from operations.
- **% Leveraged Positions of Total Positions**: Monitor leveraged positions to assess risk.
- **Gross Margins Increasing or Stable**: High and stable gross margins indicate pricing power.
- **Interest Coverage Ratio > 4**: Ability to cover interest expenses comfortably.
- **Promoter Pledging < 5%**: Low promoter pledging reduces risk of forced selling.
- **Capex Expansion or Completion**: Look for companies investing in growth or completing projects.
- **Related Party Transactions**: Should be minimal and transparent.
