## 1. Summary

Epack Durable Limited (EPACK), currently positioned as the second-largest Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) of room air conditioners (RAC) in India, represents a compelling, albeit volatile, play on the structural deepening of India's manufacturing ecosystem. As of January 2026, the company stands at a complex intersection of aggressive strategic expansion and severe short-term operational dislocation. The fiscal year 2026 (FY26) has evolved into a transitional period characterized by a distinct dichotomy: a robust strengthening of long-term fundamentals through high-value partnerships (Hisense, Panasonic) and capacity expansion, contrasted sharply against a temporary collapse in financial performance due to exogenous shocks in the second quarter.

The market, reacting to the precipitous 95% decline in EBITDA during Q2 FY26 3, has de-rated the stock significantly, pushing valuations to attractive levels relative to peers like Amber Enterprises and Dixon Technologies. We argue that the current earnings depression is cyclical and event-driven—triggered by unseasonal rains, inventory destocking, and policy friction—rather than structural.

**Core Investment Arguments:**

* **Strategic De-risking via Diversification:** EPACK is aggressively shedding its identity as a pure-play, seasonal RAC manufacturer. The non-RAC portfolio, comprising Small Domestic Appliances (SDA) and Large Domestic Appliances (LDA), is scaling rapidly. In Q2 FY26, despite the overall slump, the SDA segment expanded by 45% QoQ and the LDA segment surged by 466% QoQ.3 This diversification is not merely additive; it is transformative, smoothing the inherent cash flow volatility associated with the summer-dependent AC business.  
* **The Export Pivot & Global Alliances:** The commissioning of the dedicated Hisense manufacturing facility in Sri City marks EPACK’s graduation from a domestic contract manufacturer to a global supply node. Management projects a $1 billion revenue opportunity over five years from this partnership alone.4 This move aligns EPACK with the "China Plus One" sourcing shift, offering a long runway for volume growth independent of domestic consumption cycles.  
* **Regulatory & Policy Tailwinds:** The reduction of GST on air conditioners from 28% to 18% acts as a potent counter-cyclical buffer.3 While the immediate impact was a liquidity freeze as channels destocked to avoid inventory losses, the long-term implication is improved affordability and demand elasticity. Furthermore, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme continues to subsidize the company’s deep backward integration, enhancing its competitive moat against assemblers relying on imports.  
* **Valuation Arbitrage:** Trading at a P/E of \~61x FY25 earnings compared to Amber Enterprises’ \>100x 5, EPACK offers a significant margin of safety. The market is currently pricing the stock on depressed FY26 earnings, ignoring the operating leverage that will kick in once the new capacities in Bhiwadi and Sri City achieve optimal utilization in FY27.

**Key Risks:**

* **Working Capital Bloat:** The inventory overhang from Q1/Q2 FY26 has stretched the working capital cycle to 112 days 6, necessitating higher short-term debt. Failure to liquidate this inventory in H2 FY26 could strain the balance sheet.  
* **Execution Risk in New Verticals:** The simultaneous ramp-up of washing machine lines and the Hisense facility involves complex execution. Any delays could defer revenue recognition and depress Return on Capital Employed (ROCE).  
* **BEE Norm Transition:** The shift to stricter energy efficiency norms in January 2026 necessitates a 5-7% price hike. In a price-sensitive market, this could temporarily dampen volume recovery.


## 2. Business Analysis: From Assembly to Integrated ODM

### 2.1 Corporate Pedigree and Evolution

Founded in 2003, EPACK began as a humble OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) for RAC brands. Its evolution into an ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) signifies a move up the value chain, where EPACK now owns the design intellectual property (IP), allowing for higher margins and deeper client stickiness.

* **2003-2012:** Contract manufacturing (OEM) focus.  
* **2012-2019:** Transition to ODM for Outdoor Units (2012), Window ACs (2014), and Indoor Units (2019).3  
* **2021-2023:** Massive infrastructure expansion with new plants in Bhiwadi and Sri City to serve the Northern and Southern markets respectively.  
* **2024-2025:** Diversification into Air Coolers, Washing Machines, and high-value components like BLDC motors.3

This trajectory demonstrates a deliberate strategy to capture a larger share of the customer's wallet by offering a "one-stop-shop" solution—from design to component manufacturing to final assembly.

### 2.2 Manufacturing Infrastructure: The Backbone

EPACK’s manufacturing footprint is strategically distributed to optimize logistics costs and serve regional demand hubs efficiently.

1. **Dehradun, Uttarakhand:** The legacy hub, critical for serving the North Indian market and handling complex assembly lines for established products.  
2. **Bhiwadi, Rajasthan:** Commissioned in 2021, this facility is part of the ELCINA Electronics Manufacturing Cluster. It is pivotal for the company’s component manufacturing strategy, housing lines for heat exchangers and plastic molding.  
3. **Sri City, Andhra Pradesh:** Commissioned in 2023, this is the crown jewel of EPACK’s expansion. Located in a special economic zone, it serves the Southern market and is the primary hub for export operations, including the dedicated line for Hisense.3  
4. **Silvassa (EPAVO JV):** A specialized unit focused on motor manufacturing, critical for the company’s backward integration into BLDC technology.

### 2.3 Product Portfolio & Revenue Mix

The company operates through four distinct business verticals. The revenue mix is actively shifting, reducing the concentration risk of the RAC segment.

**Table 1: Business Segment Overview**

| Segment | Key Products | Revenue Contribution Trend | Strategic Importance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Room Air Conditioners (RAC)** | Window ACs, Split ACs (IDU/ODU), Inverter ACs | **Decreasing** (56% in H1 FY26 vs 80% historically) 3 | The cash cow. Generates bulk of revenue but introduces high seasonality volatility. Focus is on maintaining market share (24%) while improving margins via component localization. |
| **Small Domestic Appliances (SDA)** | Induction Cooktops, Mixer Grinders, Air Fryers, Water Dispensers | **Increasing** (Growing 45% QoQ) | High asset turnover, low seasonality. Air fryers and induction cooktops are high-growth categories driven by urbanization. |
| **Large Domestic Appliances (LDA)** | Air Coolers, Washing Machines | **Emerging** (Grew 466% QoQ) | The next growth frontier. Washing machines offer year-round demand and leverage the same distribution logistics as ACs. |
| **Components** | Heat Exchangers, PCBAs, Cross Flow Fans, Universal Motors | **Increasing** (Grew 73% QoQ) | Margin accretive. Allows EPACK to sell to competitors/peers (e.g., Panasonic tie-up), diversifying revenue sources. |

### 2.4 Backward Integration: The Margin Defense

EPACK distinguishes itself from pure-play assemblers through deep backward integration. The company manufactures substantially all critical components in-house, except compressors.

* **Heat Exchangers:** Capabilities include 5mm and 7mm heat exchangers, crucial for meeting higher energy efficiency standards.  
* **PCBAs (Printed Circuit Board Assemblies):** With the Panasonic tie-up, EPACK is enhancing its capability to manufacture controllers, the "brain" of modern inverter ACs.  
* **Motors:** Through the Epavo JV, EPACK manufactures universal and BLDC motors. This is critical because motors are a high-value component, and in-house production protects against import price volatility.  
* **Injection Molding & Sheet Metal:** Reduces dependence on localized vendors and ensures quality control for the aesthetic parts of the appliances.

This integration allows EPACK to capture value at multiple stages of production, defend margins during periods of commodity inflation, and offer faster turnaround times to OEM clients.


## 3. Financial Analysis: Assessing the FY26 Dislocation

### 3.1 The Q2 FY26 Earnings Shock

The financial results for Q2 FY26 (ended September 30, 2025\) were a severe negative surprise, forcing a recalibration of near-term estimates.

Table 2: Q2 FY26 Consolidated Performance Snapshot

| Metric | Q2 FY26 (INR Cr) | Q2 FY25 (INR Cr) | Change (YoY) | Q1 FY26 (INR Cr) | Change (QoQ) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Revenue** | 213.3 | 377.1 | \-43.4% | 662.4 | \-67.8% |
| **EBITDA** | 0.5 | 9.6 | \-94.8% | 54.6 | \-99.1% |
| **EBITDA Margin** | 0.23% | 2.55% | \-232 bps | 8.24% | \-801 bps |
| **Net Profit (PAT)** | (22.2) | (8.5) | N/A (Loss widened) | 22.9 | N/A (Profit to Loss) |
| **EPS (INR)** | (2.32) | (0.89) | \- | 2.39 | \- |

**Analysis of the Slump:**

1. **Revenue Collapse:** The 43% YoY and 67.8% QoQ decline in revenue is alarming. Management attributed this to an "inventory overhang" from Q1. The unseasonal rains in Q1 meant that the primary sales (factory to dealer) made in Q1 did not convert to secondary sales (dealer to consumer). Consequently, brands stopped lifting new stock in Q2 to clear existing channels.3  
2. **Negative Operating Leverage:** The manufacturing business has high fixed costs (employee salaries, plant maintenance, depreciation). When revenue falls by \~68% QoQ, these fixed costs consume the entire gross margin. Employee expenses and other fixed overheads did not scale down in proportion to revenue, leading to the 95% EBITDA wipeout.  
3. **Policy Friction:** The GST rate cut announcement (28% to 18%) created a liquidity trap. Dealers stopped buying, waiting for the new lower tax rates to apply to their inventory purchases. This halted primary sales for nearly half the quarter.3

### 3.2 Half-Yearly (H1 FY26) Resilience

Despite the Q2 washout, the H1 numbers show some structural resilience, primarily due to a strong Q1.

* **H1 Revenue:** INR 876 Cr (-24% YoY).  
* **H1 EBITDA:** INR 56 Cr (-8% YoY).  
* **Margin Stability:** H1 EBITDA margin actually expanded to **6.44%** from 5.34% in H1 FY25.3 This is a crucial insight—it proves that when volumes are normalized (as they were in Q1), EPACK’s backward integration and operational efficiencies are actually *improving* margins year-on-year. The Q2 loss is a volume issue, not a cost-structure issue.

### 3.3 Balance Sheet and Working Capital Analysis

The operational slowdown has transmitted stress to the balance sheet, specifically in working capital and debt levels.

**Working Capital Cycle Deterioration:**

* **Inventory Days:** Spiked to **106 days** in Sep 2025 vs. 98 days in Mar 2025\.6 The company is holding finished goods that weren't lifted by brands.  
* **Payable Days:** Decreased to **49 days** from 91 days. This puts immense pressure on cash flows; the company is paying suppliers faster than it is selling inventory.  
* **Cash Conversion Cycle:** Blew out to **112 days** vs. 57 days in FY25. This indicates cash is trapped in the system, necessitating external funding.

**Debt Profile:**

* **Gross Debt:** Increased to **INR 688.7 crores** (Sep 2025\) from INR 369.7 crores (Mar 2025).  
* **Net Debt:** INR 677.1 crores.  
* Net Debt/Equity Ratio: Deteriorated to 0.71x from 0.37x.6  
  The sharp rise in debt is utilized to fund the trapped working capital and continuing capex for the Hisense and Sri City plants. While 0.71x is not alarming for a manufacturing company in expansion mode, the trend requires monitoring. De-leveraging will only happen once the Q3/Q4 season liquidates the inventory.


## 4. Operational Deep Dive: Segmental Performance

### 4.1 Room Air Conditioners (RAC): Weathering the Storm

The RAC segment remains the barometer for EPACK's fortunes, contributing 56% of H1 FY26 revenue.

* **Performance:** A **76% QoQ decline** in Q2 confirms the extreme seasonality and the "bullwhip" impact of the inventory correction.3  
* **Strategic Outlook:** Management expects FY26 to be "flattish" for the industry. This implies EPACK is unlikely to see volume growth in RACs this fiscal. The strategy has shifted to value preservation—maintaining relationships with key clients like Voltas, Haier, and Havells while preparing for the FY27 upcycle.  
* **Pricing Power:** The upcoming 5-7% price hike in Jan 2026 to offset BEE norms and copper inflation will test the brand's pricing power. If competitors absorb costs to gain share, EPACK margins could remain under pressure.

### 4.2 Small Domestic Appliances (SDA): The High-Growth Vector

This segment is the star performer, growing **45% QoQ** even in a down quarter.3

* **Product Drivers:** Air fryers have seen explosive adoption in urban India. EPACK’s ability to design and manufacture these locally (vs. imports) gives it a cost advantage. Mixer grinders and induction cooktops provide a steady baseload volume.  
* **Role in Portfolio:** SDA acts as a hedge against weather risk. Demand for kitchen appliances is driven by festivals (Diwali) and replacement cycles, independent of the summer heat that dictates AC sales. The target is to increase SDA contribution to **35% of total revenue**.4

### 4.3 Large Domestic Appliances (LDA): The Future Anchor

Growing **466% QoQ**, albeit on a small base, this segment represents EPACK's entry into complex white goods beyond ACs.

* **Washing Machines:** The company is ramping up capacity for semi-automatic and fully automatic machines. This is a strategic adjacency; the same dealers who sell ACs also sell washing machines.  
* **Air Coolers:** A natural extension of the cooling portfolio, targeting a lower price point consumer segment compared to ACs.

### 4.4 Components: The B2B Opportunity

Growing **73% QoQ**, the components division is pivoting from captive consumption to external sales.

* **Strategic Shift:** By selling PCBAs and heat exchangers to other OEMs (who may even be competitors in the finished goods space), EPACK maximizes asset utilization of its expensive component machinery. The Panasonic tie-up is a validation of this strategy—Panasonic is buying components from EPACK, validating their quality standards.


## 5. Strategic Alliances & Capital Expenditure

### 5.1 The Hisense Partnership: A Billion Dollar Bet

The exclusive manufacturing agreement with Hisense is the most significant strategic development for EPACK's medium-term outlook.

* **Deal Structure:** EPACK will manufacture Hisense-branded ACs and home appliances at a dedicated facility in Sri City.7  
* **Scale:** Management projects a revenue potential of **$1 billion over 5 years**.4  
* **Status:** The facility is mechanically complete. Licenses are secured. Mass production is scheduled for **January 2026**.3  
* **Implication:** This deal alone could double EPACK’s current revenue base over the next 3-4 years. It also diversifies the client base away from dependency on Indian legacy brands like Voltas.

### 5.2 Panasonic and Daikin Collaborations

EPACK has entered into manufacturing tie-ups with Panasonic Life Solutions and Daikin.3

* **Scope:** Manufacture of critical components like PCBAs and copper parts.  
* **Strategic Value:** These are global Japanese giants known for "Zero Defect" tolerance. Serving them acts as a quality certification for EPACK, potentially attracting other premium global OEMs. It marks EPACK's entry into the high-margin EMS (Electronics Manufacturing Services) space, moving beyond simple mechanical assembly.

### 5.3 Capex Roadmap

To support these initiatives, EPACK incurred **INR 129 crores** in capex in Q2 FY26 alone.3

* **Total Plan:** INR 450-500 crores over 12-18 months.8  
* **Allocation:**  
  * **Sri City:** Capacity expansion for Hisense and export lines.  
  * **Bhiwadi:** Tooling for washing machines and air fryers.  
  * **Component Lines:** Upgrading lines for BEE norm compliance.  
* **Funding:** The company had \~INR 230 crores from IPO proceeds earmarked for capex.9 The shortfall is being funded by debt, explaining the rise in leverage.


## 6. Industry Landscape & Regulatory Analysis

### 6.1 Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) Norms (Jan 2026\)

Effective January 1, 2026, the BEE has tightened energy efficiency standards. A model rated 5-star in 2025 is downgraded to 4-star or 3-star in 2026\.

* **Technological Impact:** Manufacturers must increase the heat exchange area (more copper) and use more efficient compressors to regain the 5-star label.  
* **Cost Impact:** This re-engineering increases the Bill of Materials (BOM) cost by **5-7%**.3  
* **Market Dynamics:** Q3 FY26 likely saw "pre-buying" by distributors stocking up on cheaper old-label inventory. Q4 FY26 may see a volume dip as consumers adjust to higher sticker prices on the new inventory.

### 6.2 GST Rationalization

The reduction of GST on ACs from 28% to 18% is a massive structural positive.3

* **Elasticity:** AC penetration in India is \<10%. High taxes were a barrier. A 10% price drop (if passed on) significantly expands the addressable market to the middle-income demographic.  
* **Timing:** While the transition caused a pause in Q2, the long-term volume benefit will be visible from the summer of 2026 (Q1 FY27).

### 6.3 Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme

EPACK is a key beneficiary of the PLI for White Goods.

* **Timeline:** FY26-27 is the final year for accruing benefits.3  
* **Financials:** The incentive acts as a direct boost to the bottom line, effectively increasing EBITDA margins by 4-6% on eligible incremental sales. This cash flow is critical for servicing the debt taken to build the PLI-compliant plants.


## 7. Comparative Competitor Analysis

The Indian EMS/ODM landscape is concentrated. EPACK competes primarily with Amber Enterprises, PG Electroplast, and Dixon Technologies.

**Table 3: Peer Comparison Benchmarking**

| Metric | Epack Durable | Amber Enterprises | PG Electroplast | Dixon Technologies |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Focus** | RAC ODM, SDA | RAC ODM, Components | Plastic Moulding, RAC | Mobile, IT Hardware |
| **Market Cap (INR Cr)** | \~2,512 10 | \~23,607 5 | \~15,000+ | \~70,000+ |
| **P/E Ratio (TTM)** | 61.4x 11 | 105.9x 5 | \~80x | \~120x |
| **Q2 FY26 Revenue Growth** | \-43.4% 12 | \-2.2% 12 | \-2.4% 12 | Strong \+ve |
| **Q2 FY26 Profit Trend** | Loss Making | Loss Making (-32 Cr) 13 | Profit decline | Profit Jump (+81%) 13 |
| **Backward Integration** | High (Motors, PCB) | Very High (Motors, Electronics) | High (Plastics) | Low (Asset Light) |

**Analysis:**

* **Vs. Amber:** Amber is the closest peer. Both reported losses in Q2 FY26, confirming the industry-wide nature of the slump (unseasonal rains, GST confusion). However, Amber trades at a nearly 70% premium (105x P/E vs 61x) due to its larger scale and diversified mobility/electronics division. This gap suggests EPACK is undervalued if it can demonstrate execution capability similar to Amber.  
* **Vs. Dixon:** Dixon operates in a different league (Mobiles/IT), driven by different PLI schemes. Its strong Q2 performance highlights that the "slump" was specific to the seasonal white goods sector, not general manufacturing.  
* **Vs. PG Electroplast:** PGEL outperformed EPACK in Q2 on relative growth 14, likely due to its strong washing machine portfolio which offset AC weakness. This validates EPACK’s strategy to aggressively enter the washing machine segment to match PGEL’s stability.


## 8. Shareholding & Market Technicals

### 8.1 Institutional Flows (Smart Money Moves)

Despite the weak stock price performance (-50% in 1 year), institutional data paints a bullish picture.

* **FIIs:** Increased holding significantly to **1.48%** in Sep 2025 from 0.41% in Jun 2025\.15 The number of FII investors rose from 28 to 33\.  
* **Mutual Funds:** Aggressive accumulation. Stake jumped to **3.16%** in Sep 2025 from just 0.36% in Mar 2025\.15  
* **Who is buying?** Funds like **Tata Infrastructure Fund** (1.56%) and **Bandhan Small Cap Fund** (1.24%) have taken substantial positions.16

**Implication:** Institutional investors are looking past the Q2 earnings "air pocket" and buying into the long-term capex and diversification story. They are using the price correction to accumulate.

### 8.2 Bulk Deals & Insider Activity

* **Recent Activity:** Dec 18, 2025 saw significant bulk deals. Entities like **Junomoneta Finsol** and **HRTI Private Limited** were buyers at \~INR 302 levels.17 This price point (higher than current CMP of 261\) suggests a floor price where value investors stepped in.  
* **Promoters:** Holding steady at **47.91%**.18 No significant selling by the Singhania or Bothra families indicates confidence.


## 9. Future Outlook

### 9.1 Revenue Growth Drivers

* **FY26 (The Pause):** Growth is muted due to the H1 inventory overhang and unseasonal rains. However, H2 recovery is expected due to pre-buying ahead of BEE norm changes in Jan 2026.
* **FY27 (The Inflection Point - Hisense Activation):**
  * Evidence: The exclusive Hisense manufacturing agreement targets $1 billion (₹8,300 Cr) revenue over 5 years.
  * Impact: Assuming a gradual ramp-up, this deal alone contributes ~₹800-1,000 Cr incrementally in FY27 as the Sri City dedicated line achieves utilisation.
* **Non-RAC Expansion (SDA & LDA):**
  * Evidence: SDA grew 45% and LDA 466% in Q2 FY26. New product lines (Washing Machines, Air Fryers) reduce seasonality.
  * Impact: Non-RAC contribution is projected to shift from ~25% to 40% by FY29, smoothing cash flows.
* **Export Hub Strategy:**
  * Evidence: Management targets exports to the Middle East/Africa via the Sri City plant.
  * Impact: Opens a new revenue stream independent of Indian summer cycles.

| Metric | FY25 (A) | FY26 (E) | FY27 (E) | FY28 (E) | FY29 (E) |
| :---- | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: |
| Total Revenue (INR Cr) | 2,171 | 2,250 | 3,200 | 4,300 | 5,500 |
| YoY Growth | 53% | ~3.6% | 42% | 34% | 28% |

### 9.2 Margins Growth Drivers

* **Operating Leverage (FY27-29):**
  * Evidence: Current capacity utilisation is suboptimal due to recent capex in Sri City and Bhiwadi. As volumes from Hisense fill this capacity, fixed cost absorption will improve drastically.
* **Backward Integration (The Moat):**
  * Evidence: In-house manufacturing of BLDC Motors (via Epavo JV) and PCBAs (via Panasonic tie-up).
  * Impact: Replacing imported motors/controllers with in-house production captures the margin previously leaked to suppliers.
* **PLI Scheme Benefits:**
  * Evidence: EPACK is a beneficiary of the PLI for White Goods.
  * Impact: Direct cash incentives of 4-6% on incremental sales of manufactured components bolster margins through FY28.

| Metric | FY25 (A) | FY26 (E) | FY27 (E) | FY28 (E) | FY29 (E) |
| :---- | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: |
| EBITDA (INR Cr) | 158 | 140 | 256 | 387 | 522 |
| EBITDA Margin | 7.3% | 6.2% | 8.0% | 9.0% | 9.5% |

### 9.3 Profits & EPS Projections

| Metric | FY25 (A) | FY26 (E) | FY27 (E) | FY28 (E) | FY29 (E) |
| :---- | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: |
| Revenue | 2,171 | 2,250 | 3,200 | 4,300 | 5,500 |
| EBITDA | 158 | 140 | 256 | 387 | 522 |
| PAT | 55 | 26 | 109 | 204 | 305 |
| EPS | 5.75 | 2.70 | 11.35 | 21.25 | 31.77 |

#### Stock Price Scenarios (3 Yr Outlook)

| Scenario | P/E | Target Price (INR) | Upside from CMP | Logic |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Bearish | 25x | 531 | ~1.03% | Execution delays in Hisense deal; prolonged weak summers; competitive pricing pressure. |
| Base | 35x | 743 | ~184% | Successful ramp-up of Hisense; washing machine launch succeeds; margins hit 9%. |
| Bullish | 45x | 956 | ~265% | Faster export adoption; aggressive market share gain (30%); PLI benefits maximised. |

## 10. Conclusion & Recommendation

Epack Durable is a classic "fallen angel" in the small-cap manufacturing space. The company has been punished for sector-wide headwinds (weather, policy) that were largely out of its control. The Q2 FY26 financial print was ugly—there is no sugarcoating a 95% EBITDA collapse.

However, equity research is about forecasting the future, not driving through the rearview mirror.

1. **The Structural Story is Intact:** The shift from OEM to ODM, deep backward integration, and diversification into SDAs are the right strategic moves.  
2. **The Catalyst is Imminent:** The Hisense production start in Jan 2026 is a tangible trigger for volume growth.  
3. **The Valuation is Attractive:** At \~61x P/E (on depressed earnings), it is significantly cheaper than Amber (105x) and Dixon (120x). As earnings normalize in FY27, the P/E will compress rapidly, or the stock will re-rate.  
4. **Smart Money is In:** The aggressive buying by Mutual Funds and FIIs in the last two quarters strongly suggests that the bottom is near.
